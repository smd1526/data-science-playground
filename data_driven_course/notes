The median can be a more robust measure of the average trend of datasets than the mean, as the latter is easily skewed by outliers.

Calculating the median requires all the data to be in memory at once. This is not an issue for calculating the mean.
It is impossible to do an exact "running" median, but it is possible to approximate.

Binapprox algorithm:
List of n numbers between x and y.
Create a histogram by placing each number in a bin x...y.
Starting from the first bin, if we sum the counts in the bins until we get just over n+1/2, then the last bin added (to the sum) must contained the median.
Choose the midpoint of that bin.

Pseudocode:

μ = mean
σ = standard deviation

minval = μ - σ
maxval = μ + σ
// any value >= maxval is ignored

width = 2σ/B
ignore_bin // value < minval
// Make B bins for counting values in minval and maxval
// 		first bin is minval <= value < minval + width

// Count the number of values in each bin

// Sum until total >= (N + 1)/2 (starting with ignore bin)
// Return the midpoint of the bin that exceeded (N + 1)/2

Downside to binapprox:
Answer is only accurate to σ/B. Must keep B large enough that this isn't a problem.


Equatorial coordinates are fixed relative to the celestial sphere, so the positions are independent of when or where the observations took place. They are defined relative to the celestial equator and the ecliptic. A point on the celestial sphere is given by two coordinates:
Right ascension: the angle from the vernal equinox to the point, going east along the celestial equator,
Declination: the angle from the celestial equator to the point, going north (negative values indicate going south).

RA usually given in hours-minutes-seconds (HMS) notation.
Full circle = 24 hours -> 1 hour in HMS = 15 degrees

Declination usually given in degrees-minutes-seconds (DMS) notation

Can calculate the angular distance between two objects on the celestial sphere:
(α1, δ1) = RA and declination of object 1
(α2, δ2) = RA and declination of object 2
