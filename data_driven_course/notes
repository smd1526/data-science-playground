The median can be a more robust measure of the average trend of datasets than the mean, as the latter is easily skewed by outliers.

Calculating the median requires all the data to be in memory at once. This is not an issue for calculating the mean.
It is impossible to do an exact "running" median, but it is possible to approximate.

Binapprox algorithm:
List of n numbers between x and y.
Create a histogram by placing each number in a bin x...y.
Starting from the first bin, if we sum the counts in the bins until we get just over n+1/2, then the last bin added (to the sum) must contained the median.
Choose the midpoint of that bin.

Pseudocode:

μ = mean
σ = standard deviation

minval = μ - σ
maxval = μ + σ
// any value >= maxval is ignored

width = 2σ/B
ignore_bin // value < minval
// Make B bins for counting values in minval and maxval
// 		first bin is minval <= value < minval + width

// Count the number of values in each bin

// Sum until total >= (N + 1)/2 (starting with ignore bin)
// Return the midpoint of the bin that exceeded (N + 1)/2

Downside to binapprox:
Answer is only accurate to σ/B. Must keep B large enough that this isn't a problem.


Equatorial coordinates are fixed relative to the celestial sphere, so the positions are independent of when or where the observations took place. They are defined relative to the celestial equator and the ecliptic. A point on the celestial sphere is given by two coordinates:
Right ascension: the angle from the vernal equinox to the point, going east along the celestial equator,
Declination: the angle from the celestial equator to the point, going north (negative values indicate going south).

RA usually given in hours-minutes-seconds (HMS) notation.
Full circle = 24 hours -> 1 hour in HMS = 15 degrees

Declination usually given in degrees-minutes-seconds (DMS) notation

Can calculate the angular distance between two objects on the celestial sphere:
(α1, δ1) = RA and declination of object 1
(α2, δ2) = RA and declination of object 2

Crossmatching using k-d trees (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree)
Crossmatching - comparing objects in one catalogue to objects in another to find the closest match.

Astropy constructs a k-d tree out of the second catalogue, letting it search through for a match for each object in the first catalogue efficiently. Constructing a k-d tree is similar to binary search. The k-dimensional space is divided into two parts recursively until each division contains only a single object. Creating a k-d tree from an astronomy catalogue works like this:
1. Find the object with the median right ascension, split the catalogue into objects left and right partitions of this.
2. Find the objects with the median declination in each partition, split the partitions into smaller partitions of objects down and up of these.
3. Find the objects with median right ascension in each of the partitions, split the partitions into smaller partitions of objects left and right of these.
4. Repeat 2-3 until each partition only has one object in it.

This creates a binary tree where each object used to split a partition (a node) links to the two objects that then split the partitions it has created (its children).

Once you've made a k-d tree out of a catalogue, finding a match to an object then works like this:
1. Calculate the distance from the object to highest level node (the root node), then go to the child node closest (in righ ascension) to the object.
2. Calculate the distance from the object to this child, then go to the child node closest (in declination) to the object.
3. Calculate the distance from the object to this child, then go to the child node closest (in right ascension) to the object.
4. Repeat 2-3 until you reach a child node with no further children (a leaf node).
5. Find the shortest distance of all distances calculated, this corresponds to the closest object.

Since each node branches into two children, a catalogue of N objects will have, on average, log2(N) nodes from the root to any leaf. So while it seems like a lot of effort to create a k-d tree, doing so lets you, for example, search the entire SuperCOSMOS catalogue of 250 million objects using only 28 distance calculations.
